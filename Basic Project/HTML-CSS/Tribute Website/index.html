                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen (A.P.J.) Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the "Missile Man of India," was one of the most respected scientists and visionaries the country has ever produced. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he played a pivotal role in India's missile and space programs.

                    Kalam's contributions to India's defense and aerospace industries were immense. As the chief scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), he was instrumental in developing India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980. His leadership in the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) led to the creation of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, and Nag missiles, earning him the title of "Missile Man of India."
                    
                    Apart from his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. His presidency was marked by a strong focus on youth empowerment, education, and national development. He was widely loved for his humility, simplicity, and dedication to inspiring students. Even after his presidency, he continued to work towards educating and motivating young minds.
                    
                    Dr. Kalam was also an acclaimed author, with books like Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020, where he shared his vision for a developed India. He believed in the power of dreams, hard work, and innovation.</p>
